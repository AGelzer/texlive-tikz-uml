This is just the files for building the TikZ-UML LaTeX package for Arch linux.

I certainly didn't write this, but I figured if I were installing it anyway, I might
as well submit the build to AUR.

You can find the source and the author on the main site:
http://www.ensta-paristech.fr/~kielbasi/tikzuml/

I wil try and keep the package updated, but there is no RSS feed, so I may forget.
